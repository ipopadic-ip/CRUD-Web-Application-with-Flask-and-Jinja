# CRUD Web Application with Flask and Jinja
This is a simple web application built using Flask for the back-end and Jinja as the templating engine for the front-end. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, managing data seamlessly through a user-friendly interface. It is designed for general-purpose use cases where users need to manage records or entities like products, users, or any other data type.

# Features
Create: Add new records to the database.

Read: View and list existing records.

Update: Modify existing records.

Delete: Remove records from the database.

The application is fully functional with a dynamic user interface powered by Jinja templates. The back-end is built with Flask, making it lightweight and easy to extend.

# Technologies Used
Flask: A lightweight Python web framework for handling back-end logic, routing, and database interaction.

Jinja: A templating engine for dynamically generating HTML on the front-end.

HTML/CSS: For rendering and styling the user interface.

SQL: For storing data.
